# Sudoyashi Colemak

This is the general colemak layout that I have started to create starting around April 8, 2019. This is geared towards trying to improve ergonomics for modifier keys than modifying the placement of alpha keys.

## April 10, 2019 -- beta1.0

Modifiers bugged? Not sure why KC_LALT and KC_GUI are not working in the correct place they are supposed to be. Will investigate.
