# sudoyashi custom colemak planck

A Colemak planck.


## Future Plans

-I want to slowly expand towards adding more songs on the list and add the functionality to this keyboard. 
-I would also like to find more comfortable ways to add parentheses, brackets, etc. for better programming and less mess-ups. 
-Macros would be great for common keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+Alt+Del or Ctrl+F

**April 13, 2019**: Currently working on making a solid foundational colemak keyboard layout for the planck. This is intended for general improvements for navigation and quality of life of for PC users. Sorry Mac users, I have long left my MacBook :(

## Current Features

QWERTY Keyboard Layout
Colemak Keyboard Layout
Tap Dance mods for navigation
- Down / PgDown
- Up / PgUp
- Esc / F11 (Full Screen)

## Issues

-Double tap feature slightly lags? Not sure if that's the inherent feature or there is a way to modify that. 
-Messy code, not currently up to QMK_Firmware writing standards
-Few comments, will add more comments when I get more features that I want ironed out
