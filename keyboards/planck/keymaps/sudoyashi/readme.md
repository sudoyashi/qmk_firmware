# sudoyashi colemak planck

A Colemak planck.


## Future Plans
- Focus on ergonomics, the placement of specific special characters like parentheses.
- Tap dance macros for copy, paste

**April 13, 2019**: Currently working on making a solid foundational colemak keyboard layout for the planck. This is intended for general improvements for navigation and quality of life of for PC users. Sorry Mac users, I have long left my MacBook :(


** May 12, 2019**: After many, many revisions, I have finally made a pretty stable version of what I believe will be my longstanding layout on the Planck. I have worked out probably 85% of the kinks and will be sending a pull request soon to the qmk firmware :)

## Current Features

**Double Tap**:
- Semicolon and Colon
- Control and F11 (full screen)
- Enter / Esc, used in conjunction with rotary encoder in the top left corner

**Rotary Encoder**:
Supporting a knob for selecting things! I missed having selection knob ever since I've used mixer and thought it was the most useful thing ever. Clockwise is down, counter-clockwise is up. Push in for enter.
